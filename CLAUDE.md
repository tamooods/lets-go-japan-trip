# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Overview

- Small static single-page app (Vanilla JS) for a collaborative Japan trip itinerary. Backed by Supabase (Postgres + Realtime + Auth). UI language: Thai (ภาษาไทย).
- No bundler or npm build step by default — files are served statically from the repository root (index.html + scripts).
- CSS is ~1900 lines in a single style.css (largest code file in the repo).

Quick commands

- Serve locally (no build):
  - npx serve .
  - or open index.html directly in a browser
- Lint & format (requires `npm install` first):
  - npm run format — auto-format with Prettier
  - npm run lint — ESLint check
  - npm run check — both lint + format check
- Runtime config (required):
  - Copy and edit config.example.js → config.js and fill Supabase credentials, MAPTILER_KEY, and UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY before running locally. (config.js is gitignored in this repo.)
  - On Vercel the repo uses vercel.json to write a runtime config.js at build time (see Deploy below).
- If you add a package.json (for tooling or migration), typical commands we use when migrating to Vite/React/TS are: (example)
  - pnpm init -y
  - pnpm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm dev
  - pnpm build

Deploy / hosting

- Vercel: vercel.json contains a buildCommand that echoes env values into config.js and sets outputDirectory: "." — note this behavior when changing build tooling.
- Database migrations and seed: Located in supabase/migrations/ (001–008) and supabase/seed.sql; these are intended to be run in the Supabase SQL Editor (no CLI migration runner in repo).

High-level architecture (big-picture)

- Single-entry static HTML: index.html loads a small set of ordered scripts and assets.
- Script load order matters (the app relies on globals):
  - config.js → db.js → day-places.js → selection.js → realtime.js → editor.js → conflict.js → script.js
- File responsibilities (high-level):

- .editorconfig, .prettierrc, eslint.config.js — Dev tooling config (indent, formatting, lint rules)
- package.json — npm scripts for lint/format (no runtime dependencies)
  - index.html — entry point, splash screen, sidebar markup, all modals (editor, conflict, selection) inline
  - config.example.js / config.js — runtime values (SUPABASE URL/KEY, TRIP_ITINERARY_ID)
  - style.css — ~2700 lines: theme vars, splash, sidebar, map, modals, animations
  - db.js — Supabase client creation, loadDays(), and loadMembers()
  - selection.js — member-identity modal; persists choice in localStorage as window.currentMember
  - realtime.js — Supabase Realtime subscription on the days table; updates DAYS + re-renders
  - editor.js — day edit modal, optimistic update via update_day_if_version RPC, sets window.\_editingDayId to suppress realtime flicker
  - conflict.js — conflict resolution modal (overwrite vs discard)
  - script.js — core UI rendering, global state (DAYS, map, markers, curIdx), utilities (el, append, formatTimeAgo, haversineKm), renderSidebar, renderMap, goTo, initApp

Key conventions and patterns (stay specific)

- DOM helpers: Use el(tag, cls, text) and append(parent, ...children) consistently. Avoid innerHTML for user data to prevent XSS.
- Global state: The app uses globals (DAYS, map, markers, curIdx). editor.js sets window.\_editingDayId to suppress realtime updates while editing. Be aware when refactoring to modules.
- Modals: Toggle with .classList.add/remove('hidden') — CSS maps hidden → display:none.
- details JSONB shape: { place, date, jp, lat, lng, acts[], badges[], travel }. `date` is a free-text label (e.g. "6 Dec"); older rows may lack it and instead pack "place _ date" into `place` — `splitPlaceDate()` in script.js falls back to splitting on `_` until re-saved through the editor.
- Optimistic locking: `update_day_if_version(p_id, p_expected_version, p_changes, p_actor text, p_actor_at text)` RPC returns { ok: false, error: 'conflict', current: row } on version mismatch; conflict.js handles this flow. (Signature changed in migration 006 — old variant with `p_actor uuid` was dropped.)
- Hard-coded itinerary ID: window.TRIP_ITINERARY_ID = 'b8f5e2a1-0000-4000-8000-000000000001' (set via config.js).

Pitfalls / gotchas specific to this repo

- There is no package.json by default. If you add tooling (ESLint, Vite, tests), create package.json and a lockfile first; remove stale node_modules before installing to avoid mismatched state.
- Adding a new JS file: remember to add it to index.html in the correct position in the load order — failing to respect order introduces runtime errors.
- `selection.js` is loaded after `db.js` and before `realtime.js` — it depends on `loadMembers()` from db.js.
- No error boundaries: initApp() will throw uncaught errors if loadDays() fails. When changing load flows, add robust error handling around DB calls.
- Map + realtime are migration hotspots: Leaflet + Supabase realtime interactions are the most complex parts to refactor — treat them as separate integration tasks.

When to change tech vs. when to stay vanilla

- This repo is intentionally vanilla and small; migrating to React/Vite/TS is recommended when the codebase will grow, more contributors join, or stricter typing/testing is required. For short-term fixes or small features, refactor modules and add tests instead of migrating.

Notes for future Claude sessions (what helps)

- If editing code, show exact file paths and line ranges for targeted edits (e.g. script.js:120-180).
- If planning a migration, include a short inventory of which UI pieces should move first (Editor modal is a good candidate).
- If you will change deployment (Vite build → dist), include the current vercel.json content and desired outputDirectory so CLAUDE can suggest correct buildCommand changes.

Where to look next (quick references)

- Migrations & seed: supabase/migrations/ and supabase/seed.sql
- Dev entry: index.html and the ordered scripts listed in the architecture section
- Runtime config: config.example.js

This CLAUDE.md intentionally focuses on repository-specific commands, architecture, and non-obvious gotchas to help future Claude Code runs be efficient and safe.
